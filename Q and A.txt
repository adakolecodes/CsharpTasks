C# FILE MOVER APP PROJECT

Write a program to move all images in your Downloads folder to an Images subfolder within the Downloads folder.

Hint: To get the full path of your Downloads folder go to Local Disk, Users, Students, Downloads. Copy the path from the path tab above.

REQUIRED:

1. Upon running your app, Images subfolder should be automatically created if it does not exist.

2. If no image file exists in the Downloads folder, prompt the user with associated message.

3. If an image in the Downloads folder has same name with an image in the Images folder an exception error is thrown thereby causing the app to crash. Handle this exception with the appropriate block to prevent the app from crashing when such condition of similarity in name is present.

BEST OF LUCK!!
