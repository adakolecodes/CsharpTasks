WHAT ARE METHODS?
A method is a code block that contains a series of statements. 
A program causes the statements to be executed by calling the 
method and specifying any required method arguments.
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.






WHY SHOULD YOU USE METHODS
Generally, methods are useful to improve code reusability by reducing code duplication.
To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.






HOW TO WRITE A METHOD
Create a method inside the Program class:
class Program
{
  public void MyMethod() 
  {
    // code to be executed
  }
}







HOW TO CALL A METHOD
To call (execute) a method, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;
In the following example, MyMethod() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:
public void MyMethod() 
{
  Console.WriteLine("I just got executed!");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  MyMethod();
}

// Outputs "I just got executed!"







WHAT THE RETURN KEYWORD DOES
The return statement is used to return value. When a program calls a function, 
the program control is transferred to the called function.





HOW TO GIVE DATA TO A METHOD (PARAMETERS)
public int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

public int Subtract(int a, int b)
{
    return a - b;
}

public void Caller()
{
    int numA = 4;
    int numB = 32;

    int result1 = Add(numA, numB);
    int result2 = Subtract(numA, numB);
}






DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATIC METHOD AND INSTANT/NON-STATIC METHOD
Firstly, the static keyword differentiates it from an instance method or class.

1. Static method is defined with the static keyword.
1. Non Static Method is defined without static keyword.
2. Static method is called by its class name
2. Non Static Method is called by making the object of a class.
3. We can’t use this keyword inside the Static Method
3. We can use thiskeyword inside Non Static Method
4. Static Method uses the memory of Class
4. Non Static Method uses a memory of an object
